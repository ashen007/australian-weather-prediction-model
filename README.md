# australian weather analysis and rain prediction

### purpose
This repository aims to deliver rain prediction models and their performance alongside weather analysis reports created with data provided by [Australien weather data](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package) between 2007 to 2017. all models used in this app are in [Australia_rain_prediction](https://github.com/ashen007/Australia_rain_prediction). live version can use in [australian rain prediction](https://australian-rain-prediction.herokuapp.com/)

### introduction
this web app has two parts which are rainfall analysis and how pressure, humidity relates to rainfall and wind direction analysis and the other part is rain prediction models comparisons on each other and users can enter data relevant to model inputs and it predicts the probability of rain or not in tomorrow. Itâ€™s published on Heroku. reports provide various pieces of information on weather data, and reports can drill down to deep using filters. comparisons on models done through ROC and ACU graphs. also predicted labels compare with true labels in histograms. confusion matrix provided with each model for more clarifications.
