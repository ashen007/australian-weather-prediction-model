# australian weather analysis and rain prediction

### purpose
purpose of this repository is to deliver rain prediction models and their performance alongside with weather analysis reports created with data provided by [Australien weather data](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package) between 2007 to 2017. all models used in this app are in [Australia_rain_prediction](https://github.com/ashen007/Australia_rain_prediction). live version can use in [australian rain prediction](https://australian-rain-prediction.herokuapp.com/)

### introduction
this web app has two parts which are rainfall analysis and how pressure, humidity relate to rainfall and wind derction analysis and the other part is rain prediction models comperisions on each others and users can enter data to relavent to model inputs and it predict probability of rain or not in tomorrow. it's publish on heroku. reports provide various informations on weather data and reports can do more drill down to deep using filters provided. comperisions on models done through ROC and ACU graphs. also predicted labels compare with true labels in histograms. confusion matrix provided with each model to more clarifications.
